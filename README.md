# GUGC AI Winter School 2023

This repository contains the results of the AI Winter School, which was held from January 4th to January 22nd, 2023. The school had eight participants who worked on various projects related to artificial intelligence. Below is a summary of the projects, including links to their presentations and colab notebooks.



## Participants

The following are the participants who took part in the AI Winter School:

### Beginner group:  February 21st, 2023 2:00 pm - 4:00 pm

The Beginner group consists of students who are new to the field of data science. During their studies, they were tasked with applying their knowledge to four interesting data sets. They analyzed the datasets and performed all the processes of predicting through machine learning models, and wrote a Colab, an interactive python tool for sharing this process and results. The following are the results of their presentations and the information about the Colab.

| Name | Dataset name  | Presentation | Colab |
|---|---|---|---|

The Advanced group consists of students who have prior experience with data science. They were asked to prepare and present a practical session for the Beginner group during the AI Winter School. During the self-study period, they explored and presented topics of their own interest.

|  | Practical session  | Self study |
|---|---|---|
| Gang Hyun Kim | [Reinforcement learning](https://example.com/) | [Reinforcement learning](https://example.com/) |
| Jong Bum Won | [Self & unsupervised learning](https://example.com/) | [Self & unsupervised learning](https://example.com/) |
| Jin Sung Oh | [Reinforcement learning](https://example.com/) | [Reinforcement learning](https://example.com/) |
| Yejin Lee | [Diffusion network](https://example.com/) | [Diffusion network](https://example.com/) |

## Conclusion

The AI Winter School was a great success, and all participants gained valuable experience working on real-world AI projects. We hope that the work presented here can be useful for future researchers and developers.
