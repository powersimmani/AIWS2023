# GUGC AI Winter School 2023

This repository contains the results of the AI Winter School, which was held from January 4th to January 22nd, 2023. The school had eight participants who worked on various projects related to artificial intelligence. Below is a summary of their projects, including links to their presentations and colab notebooks.


## Beginner group: self study with real-world datasets

The Beginner group consists of students who are new to the field of data science. During their studies, they were tasked with applying their knowledge to four interesting data sets. They analyzed the datasets and performed all the processes of predicting through machine learning models, and wrote a Colab, an interactive python tool for sharing this process and results. The following are the results of their presentations and the information about the Colab.
